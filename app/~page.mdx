# Report for Dr Barbur

## Comments from School Reports {#comments-from-school-reports}


### Grade 1

> At times needs to be encouraged to finish and “get on with” the next task.

### Grade 5

> Dale is often carried away with the content of his assignments and consequently finds himself running out of time and handing in work poorly presented.

### Year 7 Geography

> Dale is an intelligent and able student who should be achieving better in geography. He needs to discipline his thoughts and work so as he comes to grips with the essence of what is being taught. At present he appears to lack the necessary determination to do of his best, as is reflected by his less than impressive results.

### Year 7 Geography (Semester 2)

> Dale could improve on his assignment results by paying closer attention to detail and taking greater care with his presentation.

### Year 7 History

> …he has the ability to excel in history if he determined [sic] to do his best.

### Year 7 Science

> Dale is a capable student who has not worked to the best of his ability this semester. He has achieved excellent results in the tests and the examination this semester but he has failed to organize and push himself to excel in practical and assignment work.

### Year 7 Class Teacher’s Report

> Dale is an extremely intelligent student who does need to work harder to achieve the results he is capable of.

### Year 8 Music
> …he must take more care with his written presentation of assignments.

### Year 8 Science
> He must make greater efforts to ensure that all set work is completed and submitted promptly.

### Year 8 Science
> With a little more care devoted to clear, logical documentation of Science activities, Dale should be able to improve his excellent Science scores even further.

### Year 8 English

> The general neatness of Dale’s work requires monitoring so that he continues to make good, orderly progress!

### Year 8 English (Semester 2)

> The semester result was a little lower than it should have been because of a few outstanding pieces of work.

### Year 9 History

> Dale has the capacity to be an excellent student. He has studied hard for tests and the examination, but has not included sufficient detailed information to enable him to score highly. This has been true for much of his homework, too, which is at times unfinished.

### Year 9 Violin Teacher

> Dale is capable of making amazing progress when an audition looms!

### Year 9 Violin Teacher (Semester 2)

> Dale worked extremely hard at his technical work for Grade 7 but perhaps left the hard work slightly late to achieve absolute perfection!!!

### Year 10 Geography

> Dale has completed a solid term’s work with *greater attention to detail*. I would like to see Dale’s result improve further. *Dale’s lack of animation in lessons is disconcerting*. I would like to see Dale contribute more willingly to lessons. [my emphasis]

### Year 10 Geography (Semester 2)

> Dale has completed tasks satisfactorily but without flair or polish.  
>
> He has been rather apathetic this Semester taking the path which required least energy and commitment. As a result the work was solid but far below the standard of which Dale is capable.

### Year 10 History

> I have found Dale somewhat pre-occupied in class this semester (mentally confusing??)

## Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria

Looking at my educational history, it appears I don't take poor academic results very well:

- Although I was offered two scholarships to study music at the University of Tasmania, I left after two years after dissatisfaction with the results I was achieving in composition, which was my major.

- With only months left to submit my master's thesis, I lost interest and gave up, because my supervisor had indicated to me that I would only *maybe* get first-class honours. I didn't feel this would be sufficient to get accepted into a PhD program overseas with financial aid.

- I lost motivation to study law after receiving mostly passes for my first-year subjects. After failing one subject, the assessment of which consisted of one 100% exam, I chose to take 12 months leave of absence. In that time, I went to Japan, and a year later, I withdrew from the course entirely.

- At the rather forceful encouragement of the psychiatrist who originally diagnosed my depression and ADHD, I tried law again, but again I was discouraged when, after studying all year for one subject, I barely passed a 100%, closed-book exam.
